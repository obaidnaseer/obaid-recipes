# Obaid Recipes Project  
This is my first project of The Odin Project.    

So far I have covered git, github and basics of the web.  
The good thing about this curriculum is that I am able to learn dynamically.  
The course is well researched and has a good community and support.

As I learn more in my course, I will add improvements and grow this project over time.

## What I've Covered So Far
Beginning with basic HTML, I have now covered css styling, using the materials used as well as my own research to give my project the tweaks I want.

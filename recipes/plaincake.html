<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Once you make a cake, you bake for the rest of your life. A cake is a basic skill every person should know.
    A plain cake is the best choice for a beginner and for a crowd.
    The cake can then be customised as per one's wish.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Self Raising Flour</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>50 grams Butter (cooking oil will also do)</li>
        <li>Caster Sugar (regular sugar also works)</li>
        <li>Half cup Milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla food flavour (You can use another food flavour if you wish such as orange flavour)</li>
        <li>Pinch of fine salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a metal pan for the batter ideally. Whip the eggs and sugar and pinch of salt first.
            Use mixer or whisker. A fork also works. Make sure all sugar grains are dissolved.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C (350F). Meanwhile line a cake pan with foil or parchment or alternatively with a little oil.
            This ensures the cake does not stick and can come out easily.</li>
        <li>Sift in the baking powder and flour. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat the milk on low to medium fire. After two minutes add in the butter. When the butter has melted, add the milk and butter mixture to the batter.</li>
        <li>Once the batter is well mixed and gives a pleasant fragrance, add the vanilla extract. Mix in.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake time!</strong> Pour in the batter into the cake baking pan. Bake for about 35 minutes.
            A fork poked in the centre of the cake should not have any wet batter on it, this is the sign that the cake is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or cold. Ideally slice the cake. <i>(Optional, add icing and decorations)</i>.</li>
        
    </ol>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One of the pillars of a week's breakfast schedule in my opinion. 
If you need a quick and nutritious breakfast, you can't go wrong with egg and toast.
This recipe uses the frying method to cook the egg.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Egg (or as many as you need)</li>
        <li>Nice slice (or slices) of bread</li>
        <li>Spices: salt, pepper (optional: herb powder, paprika, any masala powder you like)</li>
        <li>10mil Oil or Butter</li>
        <li>Optional Sauces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil or butter in a small to medium pan. Use medium heat. If using butter make sure it is melted.</li>        
        <li>Crack the egg using a spoon or an edge of the stove. Split the egg and add into pan. Cover the pan or flip the egg. 
            Alternatively if you have enough oil you can use the spoon the oil over the yolk to ensure the egg is cooked.</li>
        <li>If the egg has turned white including over the yolk. Switch off the heat.</li>
        <li>Toast your bread to you desired level. Add butter on one side if you wish.</li>
        <li>Put the egg on a plate and sprinkle the spices on top.</li>
        <li>Ensure egg is not piping hot and serve hot or warm.</li>
        
    </ol>

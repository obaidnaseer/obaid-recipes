<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Ingredients (Serves 4)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams uncooked pasta</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>200 grams Fresh Mixed Vegetables or Frozen Mixed Vegetables</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Vegetable Oil or Sunflower Oil</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons salt (per taste)</li>
        <li>500ml Tomato Paste or 500g chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>Cheese of Choice (70-100 grams)</li>
        <li>1 Vegetable Stock Cube</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp red chilli powder (optional)</li>
        <li>Herbs for flavour/garnish (optional, you can use basil or thyme)</li>
        <li>Two cloves of garlic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water.
            Use packet instructions. Simultaneously Boil the vegetables. See steps 1 and 2.</li>
        <li>Chop the fresh vegetables, or if using frozen vegetables, ensure they are defrosted. You can use hot water to speed up the process.</li>
        <li>Boil the vegetables in salted water. Simmer for 5 minutes or according to packet instructions.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, leaving a minute amount of water.</li>
        <li>Drain the vegetables, again leaving a small amount of water.</li>
        <li>In a pot or pan heat the onions in 1 tablespoon of oil. Make sure they are light brown.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables to the onions or vice versa, make sure the pot is big enough as the pasta will be added later.</li>
        <li>In another pot or within the vegetable pot, add 3 tablespoons of oil. Stir well.
            Make sure vegetables are cooked in oil for two minutes. Use medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce and optional herbs. Use a blender to blend the tomatoes if not using a sauce. The herbs can be added in the blending stage.</li>
        <li>If you did not use a blender to add the spices, then follow this step. Add a teaspoon of salt.
            Add the vegetable stock cube. Add the garlic cloves after mashing them. 
            You can use the flat side of the knife to mash them, then further cut them more.</li>
        <li>vegetables should cook with the pasta sauce for 5 minutes after the tomato paste has started boiling.</li>
        <li>Run the cooked pasta under cold water. You may use a colander or add cold water and drain within the pot with the lid on top. 
            Add the pasta to the vegetable pot. 
            Mix everything well whilst ensuring the pasta is not broken into pieces.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to the lowest setting. Mix in cheese. Or just on top if some people don't like the cheese. 
            Place the lid on completely and leave for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with garnish.</li>
